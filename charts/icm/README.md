## Installing the Chart

### Add the Intershop Helm repository

Before installing Intershop helm charts, you need to add the [Intershop helm repository](https://intershop.github.io/helm-charts) to your helm client

```bash
helm repo add intershop https://intershop.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### Install Chart via repository

To install the chart with the release name `icm` execute

```bash
helm install my-release intershop/icm --values=values.yaml --namespace icm
```

### Install Chart via cloned helm-charts repo

```bash
cd charts
helm dependency update icm
helm install my-release ./icm --values=values.yaml --namespace icm
```

## Test execution

This helm chart also allows you to execute intershop htmlunit tests via a testrunner.

### Execute locally
For the local test execution there are already preconfigured values-files orchestrated by a bash script.
Follow these steps to execute a test:

1. add a "intershop-license" k8s secret with a valid intershop license
2. adjust the `start-test-local_vars.sh` to your needs (which docker image to test, which testsuite)
3. in `values-test-local.yaml` set sites-, pagecache-, testdata-dir to the ones from your system, same lasts for mssql-data and -backup
4. also adjust the imagePullSecrets for icm-as and the testrunner here `values-test-local.yaml` to be able/authorized to download the docker image
4. Run: `./start-test-local.sh`
