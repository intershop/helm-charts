Dependency Information
======================

For the best compatibility between IOM Helm Charts and IOM, always use the latest version of IOM Helm Charts,
regardless of which IOM version you are currently using. Therefore, update IOM Helm Charts as often as possible.

The current version of Helm Charts is backward compatible with all versions of IOM since 4.0. But only the latest
IOM version, which is 5.0.0 at the time of writing, supports all features that the Helm Charts offer. For more
information, please consult the reference documentation of `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

IOM Helm charts are requiring the usage of Helm 3.8 or newer. At the time of writing, functionality was tested
up to version 3.14 of Helm.

The current version of Helm Charts is backward compatible with all versions of IOM since 4.0. But only the newest
IOM version, which is 5.0.0 at the time of writing, supports all features that the Helm Charts are offering. For more
information, please consult the reference documentation of `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

New Features
------------

Update of mailhog sub-chart
===========================

Mailhog sub-chart was updated to version 5.2.3.

Added Support for *New Relic APM*
=================================

Helm Charts of version 3.0 are now supporting the usage of *New Relic APM* (Application Performance Monitoring). *New
Relic APM* can be managed by new Helm paramters within parameter-group *newRelic*.

For a description of all new Parameters in detail, please see `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

The usage of *New Relic APM* requires the usage of IOM version 5.0.0 or newer.

Random JWT-secret provided
==========================

On default a secret for JWT is created automatically, containing a random value.

It is still possible to define custom values, by using the parameters *oms.jwtSecret* and *oms.jwtSecretKeyRef*.

Handling of persistent storage for the Shared File System was improved
==================================================================

The configuration and documentation of persistent storage for the Shared File System was improved.

A new documentation page "`Persistent Storage <docs/PersistentStorage.rst>`_" was added, that describes the configuration of
the Shared File System in detail. Documentation of "`Helm Parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_" was updated.

Please note, that the new configuration requires migration of Helm parameters. 

---------------
Migration Notes
---------------

Removal of internal NGINX
=========================

Internal NGINX, which was an optional component of IOM Helm Charts, was removed. The internal NGINX could be used in the
following cases:

1. The main goal of the internal NGINX was to act as a proxy between Ingress controller and IOM application servers in case,
   the Ingress controller had no ability to provide session stickiness. In this case, the internal NGINX was able to
   handle session stickiness for IOM.
2. In very simple demo and test installations, the internal NGINX could also be used as Ingress controller. This made the
   setup easier, since the installation of a cluster wide Ingress controller could be skipped.

If an installation is currently using the internal NGINX (parameter *nginx.enabled* is set to *true*), then measures
have to be taken before using IOM Helm Charts 3.0.0. Depending on the use-case, which leads to the usage of the internal
NGINX, the measures are different.

1. Session stickiness has to be provided by the Ingress controller, otherwise IOM can not be operated. If an NGINX Ingress
   controller is used, the IOM Helm Charts already provide the required configuration settings. If any other Ingress
   controller is used, you have to determine how to configure it in order to provide session stickiness. The according
   configuration has then to be applied in the Helm values.
2. Simple demo and test installations now have to use a separately installed Ingress controller. Preferred is an NGINX
   Ingress controller, since the required configuration for session stickiness is already provided by IOM Helm Charts.

Default value of *mailhog.probes.enabled* has changed
=====================================================

The default value of *mailhog.probes.enabled* was changed from *true* to *false*, meaning that there are no probes executed
unless requested. This new setting reduces the amount of log-messages of mailhog even if default values are used.

*dbaccount.resetData* was replaced by *oms.db.resetData*
========================================================

Parameter *dbaccount.resetData* was replaced by *oms.db.resetData*. For a limited period of time (until the next major release of IOM
Helm charts), the old parameter *dbaccount.resetData* will still be supported.
Usage of new parameter *oms.db.resetData* requires IOM version 5.0.0 or newer.

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Default value of *oms.jwtSecret* has changed
============================================

The default value of *oms.jwtSecret* is empty now, causing the usage of an automatically created random secret. That means, if you
have not set *oms.jwtSecret* and *oms.jwtSecretKeyRef*, this automatically created secret will be used instead. 

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Default value of *jboss.javaOpts* has changed
=============================================

The default value of *jboss.javaOpts* was changed, in order to reduce the memory usage of Java from 85% to 80%.

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Changed default values of *image.tag* and *dbaccount.image.tag*
===============================================================

The default value of the IOM version (parameter *image.tag*) was changed to 5.0.0 and the default value of the dbaccount version
(parameter *dbaccount.image.tag*) was updated to 2.0.0.

Handling of persistent storage for the Shared File System was improved
==================================================================

In former versions of IOM Helm charts, the provisioning of a persistent storage method depended on the two parameters, *persistence.hostPath*
and *persistence.storageClass*. There was also a third parameter, *persistence.pvc*, but that
one was removed. There was a precedence defined for these parameters to select the provisioning method: if *persistence.hostPath* was set,
*persistence.storageClass* was ignored.

This has now changed. The new parameter *persistence.provisioning* was introduced, that explicitly defines the provisioning method to be used.
Allowed values for *persistence.provisioning* are *dynamic* (default), *static*, and *local*.

- *dynamic* is equivalent to an old configuration, where *persistence.hostPath* and *persistence.pvc* were both not set.
- *static* is a new provisioning method, that was not supported by older versions of IOM Helm charts.
- *local* is equivalent to an old configuration, where *persistence.hostPath* was set, but *persistence.pvc* was not.

Each provisioning method can be configured in more detail. Therefore, separate parameter-groups were introduced, which mirror the names
of the provisioning methods: *persistence.dynamic|static|local*.

The old parameter *persistence.storageClass* belongs to *dynamic* provisioning. Therefore, it was renamed to *persistence.dynamic.storageClass*.
The old parameter *persistence.hostPath* belongs to *local* provisioning and was therefore renamed to *persistence.local.hostPath*.

The former parameter *persistence.annotations* was split into three different parameters, one
for each provisioning method: *persistence.dynamic|static|local.annotations*. This
way, it became possible to define different default annotations for the different provisioning methods.

In the former version of IOM Helm charts, the following annotations for *persistent-volume-claim* were used in every case:

.. code-block:: yaml

    "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install

In the current version of IOM Helm charts, there are no default annotations at all for *persistence.static.annotations* and *persistence.local.annotations*.
Only in case of *dynamic* provisioning, there is a single default annotation:

.. code-block:: yaml

    "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep

.. note::

  Under some circumstances, ``helm upgrade`` is not able to proceed due to an *annotation validation error*, when using the
  *dynamic* provisioning mode. To avoid this case, you need to manually add annotations to the existing *persistent-volume-claim*
  in advance.

  The following code shows, how this could be done.

  .. code-block:: shell
                  
    # replace <namespace> and <release-name> with actual values
    NAMESPACE=<namespace>
    RELEASE_NAME=<release-name>
                  
    kubectl annotate pvc ${RELEASE_NAME}-iom  meta.helm.sh/release-name=$RELEASE_NAME
    kubectl annotate pvc ${RELEASE_NAME}-iom  meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=$NAMESPACE

+----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Changed default value of *postgres.image.tag*
=============================================

The default value of PostgreSQL version (parameter *postgres.image.tag*) was changed from 12 to 15.

-----------------
Deprecation Notes
-----------------

Support for *Datadog APM* is deprecated
=======================================

The Usage of *Datadog APM* (Application Performance Monitoring) is deprecated. The according parameter group *datadogApm*
will be removed in a future version of IOM Helm Charts.

-------------
Removal Notes
-------------
          
IOM prior version 4 is not supported any longer
===============================================

IOM Helm charts of version 3.0.0 are only supporting IOM 4 and newer.

Meta-Data were removed from *log*-Settings
==========================================

Helm parameters *log.metaData.tenant* and *log.metaData.environment* were removed from settings.

=============
Version 3.0.0
=============

The current version of IOM Helm charts does not support any longer passing the name of an existing
*persistent-volume-claim* to be used for the Shared File System.

Mailhog sub-chart was replaced by Mailpit sub-chart
===================================================

_Mailhog_ and the according sub-chart were not maintained properly any longer. Therefore it was replaced by the more modern _Mailpit_ project.

Added Support for *New Relic APM*
=================================

Helm Charts 3.0 now support the use of *New Relic APM* (Application Performance Monitoring). *New
Relic APM* can be managed through new Helm parameters within the *newRelic* parameter group. 

For a detailed description of all new parameters, see `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

*New Relic APM* requires IOM version 5.0.0 or later.

Random JWT-secret provided
==========================

By default, a secret for JWT is created automatically, containing a random value.

It is still possible to define custom values, by using the parameters *oms.jwtSecret* and *oms.jwtSecretKeyRef*.

Improved Handling of persistent storage for the shared file system
==================================================================

The configuration and documentation of persistent storage for the shared file system was improved.

A new documentation page "`Persistent Storage <docs/PersistentStorage.rst>`_" was added, detailing the configuration of the shared file system.
Furthermore, the documentation of "`Helm Parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_" was updated.

Note that the new configuration requires a migration of Helm parameters.

Improved handling of persistent storage for PostgreSQL data
===========================================================

The configuration of persistent storage for PostgreSQL data was improved. The configuration is now completely identical
to the configuration of persistent storage for the shared file system.

The new documentation page "`Persistent Storage <docs/PersistentStorage.rst>`_" applies to persistent storage for
PostgreSQL data too, except for the *Recommendations*-section, which only applies to the shared file system.

Added configuration option to set metrics endpoint
==================================================

Starting with IOM 5.0.0, the *Wildfly* application server has changed the way it handles metrics data. Instead of providing data
in *Prometheus* format to be pulled, the data is now pushed in *OpenTelemetry* format. The new configuration option
*jboss.metricsEndpoint* allows you to specify where the metrics data should be sent.

For more information, see `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Requires IOM version 5.0.0 or later.

Helm version 3.8 or newer is required
=====================================

IOM Helm charts of version 3.0.0 are requiring the usage of Helm 3.8 or newer. At the time of writing, functionality was tested
up to version 3.14 of Helm.

Removal of internal NGINX
=========================

Internal NGINX, which was an optional component of IOM Helm Charts, was removed. The internal NGINX could be used in the
following cases:

1. The main goal of the internal NGINX was to act as a proxy between the Ingress controller and the IOM application servers in case
   the Ingress controller did not have the ability to provide session stickiness. In this case, the internal NGINX was able to
   handle session stickiness for IOM.
2. In very simple demo and test installations, the internal NGINX could also be used as Ingress controller. This made the
   setup easier, since the installation of a cluster-wide Ingress controller could be skipped.

If an installation is currently using the internal NGINX (*nginx.enabled* parameter is set to *true*), then measures must be taken 
before using IOM Helm Charts 3.0.0. Depending on the use case that is causing the internal NGINX to be used, the steps will vary.

1. Session stickiness must be provided by the Ingress controller, otherwise IOM can not be operated. If an NGINX Ingress
   controller is used, the IOM Helm Charts already provide the required configuration settings. If any other Ingress
   controller is used, you have to determine how to configure it in order to provide session stickiness. The appropriate 
   configuration must then be applied to the Helm values.
2. Simple demo and test installations must now use a separately installed Ingress controller. Preferred is an NGINX
   Ingress controller, since the required configuration for session stickiness is already provided by IOM Helm Charts.

Mailhog sub-chart was replaced by Mailpit sub-chart
===================================================

The _Mailhog_ sub-chart was replaced by _Mailpit_. Please have a look at the *values.yaml* file to get information about basic configuration.

See also `Helm parameters of Mailpit <docs/ParametersMailpit.rst>`_.

*dbaccount.resetData* was replaced by *oms.db.resetData*
========================================================

Parameter *dbaccount.resetData* was replaced by *oms.db.resetData*.

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Default value of *oms.jwtSecret* has changed
============================================

The default value of *oms.jwtSecret* is now empty, causing the usage of an automatically generated random secret. This means that if you
have not set *oms.jwtSecret* and *oms.jwtSecretKeyRef*, this automatically generated secret will be used instead. 

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Default value of *jboss.javaOpts* has changed
=============================================

The default value of *jboss.javaOpts* was changed to reduce the memory usage of Java from 85% to 80%.

See also `Helm parameters of IOM <docs/ParametersIOM.rst>`_.

Changed default values of *image.tag* and *dbaccount.image.tag*
===============================================================

The default value of the IOM version (parameter *image.tag*) was changed to 5.0.0 and the default value of the dbaccount version
(parameter *dbaccount.image.tag*) was updated to 2.0.0.

Improved handling of persistent storage for the shared file system
==================================================================

.. regular warnings are not rendered correctly in GitHub

**Warning**
   
   If persistent storage for the shared file system has been configured via *persistence.hostPath*, upgrading the Helm release is not supported.

In previous versions of IOM Helm Charts, the provisioning of a persistent storage method depended on the two parameters, *persistence.hostPath*
and *persistence.storageClass*. There was also a third parameter, *persistence.pvc*, but it has been removed. 
There was a precedence defined for these parameters to select the provisioning method: if *persistence.hostPath* was set,
*persistence.storageClass* was ignored.

This has now changed. The new parameter *persistence.provisioning* was introduced. It explicitly defines the provisioning method to be used.
Allowed values for *persistence.provisioning* are *dynamic* (default), *static*, and *local*.

- *dynamic* is equivalent to an old configuration where both *persistence.hostPath* and *persistence.pvc* were not set.
- *static* is a new provisioning method that was not supported by previous versions of IOM Helm Charts.
- *local* is equivalent to an old configuration where *persistence.hostPath* was set, but *persistence.pvc* was not.

Each provisioning method can be configured in more detail. Therefore, separate parameter groups which mirror the names
of the provisioning methods were introduced: *persistence.dynamic|static|local*.

The old parameter *persistence.storageClass* belongs to *dynamic* provisioning. Therefore, it was renamed to *persistence.dynamic.storageClass*.
The old parameter *persistence.hostPath* belongs to *local* provisioning and was therefore renamed to *persistence.local.hostPath*.

The former parameter *persistence.annotations* was split into three different parameters, one
for each provisioning method: *persistence.dynamic|static|local.annotations*. This
way, it became possible to define different default annotations for the different provisioning methods.

In the former version of IOM Helm Charts, the following annotations for *persistent-volume-claim* were used in every case:

.. code-block:: yaml

    "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install

In the current version of IOM Helm Charts, there are no default annotations at all for *persistence.static.annotations* and *persistence.local.annotations*.
Only in case of *dynamic* provisioning, there is a single default annotation:

.. code-block:: yaml

    "helm.sh/resource-policy": keep

.. regular warnings are not rendered correctly in GitHub

**Note**

  Under certain circumstances, ``helm upgrade`` is not able to proceed due to an *annotation validation error* when using the
  *dynamic* provisioning mode. To avoid this case, you need to manually add annotations to the existing *persistent-volume-claim*
  in advance.

  The following code shows, how this could be done.

  .. code-block:: shell
                  
    # replace <namespace> and <release-name> with actual values
    NAMESPACE=<namespace>
    RELEASE_NAME=<release-name>
                  
    kubectl annotate pvc ${RELEASE_NAME}-iom  meta.helm.sh/release-name=$RELEASE_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
    kubectl annotate pvc ${RELEASE_NAME}-iom  meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=$NAMESPACE -n $NAMESPACE
