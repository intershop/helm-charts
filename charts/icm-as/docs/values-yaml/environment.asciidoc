== Description

Allows to define environment variables for `icm-as-server` and `jobserver` containers. The environment variables are defined as a yaml object containing attributes that specify the variable name and value. The attribute's name is used as the environment variable's name, and the attribute's value is used as the environment variable's value. These environment variables control the behavior of the Intershop Commerce Management Application Server at different levels:

* Startup of the container
* Runtime configuration of the application server

[TIP]
====
See https://support.intershop.com/kb/index.php/Display/301L43[ICM Concept Configuration paragraph 5.1.] for details on how to name environment variables to be read as ICM configuration properties.

=== Example

[source,yaml]
----
environment:
  CARTRIDGE_LIST: ft_icm_as <1>
  INTERSHOP_WEBSERVERURL: http://my-host.intershop.com:80 <2>
  INTERSHOP_WEBSERVERSECUREURL: https://my-host.intershop.com:443 <3>
----

This example defines three environment variables:

<1> CARTRIDGE_LIST: `ft_icm_as`
<2> INTERSHOP_WEBSERVERURL: `http://my-host.intershop.com:80`
<3> INTERSHOP_WEBSERVERSECUREURL: `https://my-host.intershop.com:443`
