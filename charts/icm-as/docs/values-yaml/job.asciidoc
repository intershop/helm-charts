== Description

Configures the usage of the `jobserver`. The `jobserver` is a separate `icm-as` pod (as a Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Job]) that is deployed by the `ICM Job Controller` which uses a custom resource called `ICMJob`. This section controls whether and how such a resource is deployed and picked up by the `ICM Job Controller`.
The following table lists the attributes of the `job` section:

[cols="1,3,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Type |Mandatory |Default Value
|enabled|Enable/disable the `jobserver`. If disabled, all jobs (depending on their configuratons) will be executed by regular `icm-as-server` pods.|boolean|{optional}|`false`
|suspend|If true, job-server-support will be available but no jobs will be created|boolean|{optional}|`false`
|pollInterval|Sets the polling interval of the ICM Job Controller in seconds|int|{optional}|`30`
|failedJobsHistoryLimit|Number of failed K8s jobs to keep before removing|int|{optional}|`1`
|successfulJobsHistoryLimit|Number of successful K8s jobs to keep before removing|int|{optional}|`3`
|nameSpecific|Determines whether outstanding jobs from the `icm-as-server` are identified based on [.placeholder]#serverName# or exclusively by using `serverGroup=JOB`|boolean|{optional}|`false`
|serverName|Custom serverName to be used when determining the current outstanding jobs from the `icm-as-server`|string|{optional}|`jobserver`
|===

=== Example
[source,yaml]
----
job:
  enabled: true <1>
  pollInterval: 10 <2>
----

<1> Enable the jobserver.
<2> Let the ICM Job Controller poll for new jobs every 10 seconds.

[WARNING]
====
When enabling the `jobserver`:

* Ensure that the `ICM Job Controller` is also deployed in your cluster. Otherwise, the `jobserver` will not be able to execute any jobs.
* The K8s jobs deployed by the `ICM Job Controller` get the server group `JOB` assigned. All regular `icm-as-server` pods get the server groups `BOS` and `WFS` assigned. Therefore, only jobs assigned to the server group `JOB` will be executed by `jobserver` pods.
