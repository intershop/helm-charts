== Description

Configures the operational context (aka _environment_) the ICM is running in. The following attributes are available:

[cols="1,3,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Type |Mandatory |Default Value
|customerId|the id of the customer|string|{mandatory}|`n_a` (default value for compatibility with older versions)
|environmentType|the type of the environment e.g.int,uat,prd|string|{optional}|`prd`
|environmentName|the name of the environment (environment-type + some sort of id, e.g. int-01)|string|{optional}|[.placeholder]#value of `environmentType`#
|===

Using these attribute and some additional information from section link:replication.asciidoc[`replication`] the `operationalContextName` is calculated as follows:

[.placeholder]#`customerId`#-[.placeholder]#`environmentName`#-[.placeholder]#`stagingType`#

with `stagingType` calculated as follows:

----
if replication.enabled=true then
  if replication.role=source then
    stagingType=edit
  else
    stagingType=live
else
  stagingType=standalone
----

=== Example

[source,yaml]
----
operationalContext:
  customerId: "myshop"
  environmentType: "uat"
  environmentName: "uat-01"

replication:
  enabled: true
  role: source
----

This example would result in the `operationalContextName` being `myshop-uat-01-edit`.
