== Make a custom TLS certificate available to the `icm-as-appserver`-container's JVM

1. Follow link: https://support.intershop.com/kb/index.php/Display/X31381[Guide - Secret Store Process] to create a secret in the K8s cluster using a certificate stored inside an Azure Key Vault.
2. Add an entry inside the link:values-yaml/secret-mounts.asciidoc[secretMounts] section

   * Reference the secret created following the guide from step 1
   * Set `type` to `certificate`
   * Set `key` to `tls.crt` or omit the `key`
   * Set `targetFile` to a valid file name using the file extension `.crt`

[source,yaml]
----
secretMounts:
  - secretName: nameOfTheSecret
    type: certificate
    key: tls.crt
    targetFile: my-certificate-file.crt
----

[NOTE]
====
The certificate will then be imported into the truststore of the JVM using the alias built from the base file name `my-certificate-file`.

== Deploy an ICM using replication/staging

=== Prerequisites

There is an ICM deployed *without* replication enabled (this system is referred to as the `source` (_edit_) server).

=== Steps

. Enable replication and configure the involved systems
  .. `replication.enabled` to `true`
  .. `replication.role` to `source`
  .. configure the `replication.source` and `replication.targets` attributes accordingly (target systems don't need to be up and running at this point)
  .. Ensure that the startup probe is configured to wait until the database is prepared for replication (`probes.startupProbe.initialDelaySeconds` is set properly - exact value depend on the database size)
. Deploy the (source) ICM
. Wait until the ICM is up and running (the database gets prepared for replication during startup)
. Transfer the database content from the source database into the target database
  .. transfer data for instance using backup + restore
  .. ensure the configured target users also have access to the source database (direct access or via database link)
. Transfer the sites content from the source `sites` volume into the target `sites` volume (e.g. using Azure's `az` command)
. Prepare a second `values.yaml` file for the target system
  .. set `replication.enabled` to `true`
  .. set `replication.role` to `target`
  .. copy the configuration of `replication.source` and `replication.targets` from the source system's `values.yaml` file
. Deploy the (target) ICM (using the second `values.yaml` file)

[TIP]
====
See the link:values-yaml/replication.asciidoc[replication] section for details about the replication configuration and link:values-yaml/probes.asciidoc[probes] section for details about the probes configuration.
