== Make a custom TLS certificate available to the `icm-as-server`-container's JVM

1. Follow link: https://support.intershop.com/kb/index.php/Display/X31381[Guide - Secret Store Process] to create a secret in the K8s cluster using a certificate stored inside an Azure Key Vault.
2. Add an entry inside the link:values-yaml.asciidoc#_secretmounts[secretMounts] section

   * Reference the secret created from step 1
   * Set `type` to `certificate`
   * Set `key` to `tls.crt` or omit the `key`
   * Set `targetFile` to a valid file name using the file extension `.crt`

   [NOTE]
   ====
   The certificate will then be imported into the truststore of the JVM using the alias built from the base file name.
