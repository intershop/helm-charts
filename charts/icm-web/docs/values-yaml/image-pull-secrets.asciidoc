= Documentation about the `values.yaml` attributes belonging to section `imagePullSecrets`
include::definitions.include[]

=== Description

Lists the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod[image pull secrets] available when pulling Docker images. So the section is a yaml array containing 0 to n string entry. Each entry is the name of a Kubernetes secret that contains credentials to access a Docker registry.

The image pull secrets already are explained in detail for the `icm-as` Helm Chart so just see link:../../../icm-as/docs/values-yaml/image-pull-secrets.asciidoc[here].
