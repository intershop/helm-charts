== Description

All `icm-web-wa` pods must send requests to the deployed `icm-as-server` pods. These pods can be accessed using the appropriate service. Therefore, the `icm-web-wa` needs to know the name of the service and the port used.

The `appServerConnection` section contains the following attributes:

[cols="1,3,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute |Description |Type |Mandatory |Default Value
|serviceName|Name of the service|string|{optional}|`icm-as`
|port|Management (`mgnt`) port|string|{optional}|`7744`

[TIP]
====
See the `icm-as` chart for details about the link:../../../icm-as/docs/values-yaml/no-section.asciidoc#_example_icmAsServiceNaming[service naming].

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
appServerConnection:
  serviceName: icm-as
  port: 7744
----

This configures the `icm-web-wa` to connect to the service `icm-as` on port `7744`.
