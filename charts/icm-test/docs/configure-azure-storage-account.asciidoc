= Configuration of an Azure Storage Account for the Test Execution

This document describes how to configure an Azure Storage Account to be used for the ICM Test execution.

== Prerequisites

* Azure CLI (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* Access to an Azure subscription

== Steps

=== 1. Create the Storage Account

In order to create the storage account, you first need to have a resource group. If you don't have one yet, you can create one using the following command:

[source,bash]
az group create --name <group-name> --location <location>

You can now create the storage account within that resource group using this command:

[source,bash]
az storage account create --name <storage-account-name> --resource-group <group-name> --location <location> --sku Standard_LRS

This can of course also be done via the link:https://portal.azure.com/[Azure Portal].

=== 2. Create File Shares

Now, create the necessary file shares within the storage account:

[source,bash]
az storage share create --name icm-sites --account-name <storage-account-name>
az storage share create --name iste-mssql-backup --account-name <storage-account-name>
az storage share create --name iste-mssql-data --account-name <storage-account-name>
az storage share create --name iste-nfs --account-name <storage-account-name>

=== 3. Copy files into the File Shares

To get the test ready for execution, the file shares need to be populated with the necessary data. This can be done in several different ways:

. Using the Azure Portal: You can upload files directly into the file shares using the Azure Portal.
. Using the Azure CLI: You can use the `az storage file upload` command to upload files to the file shares.
. Using Azure Storage Explorer: You can use the link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer[Azure Storage Explorer] tool to easily manage and upload files to your Azure Storage account.

The file shares correspond to the files in your local persistent volumes folder in the following way:

* icm-sites: <local-persistent-volumes-folder>/sites
* iste-mssql-backup: <local-persistent-volumes-folder>/mssql/backup
* iste-mssql-data: <local-persistent-volumes-folder>/mssql/data
* iste-nfs: <local-persistent-volumes-folder>/testdata

Your Azure Storage Account is now ready for use.
