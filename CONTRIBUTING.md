## Commit Message Guidelines

In general we comply with the rules and formats of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
These rules are essential to our automated release process and the later rollout of a helm chart. Commit messages will be used to determine the new semantic version and shall help updating existing projects.

Some rules to be emphasized for chart related commits:
* Every commit containing a `BREAKING_CHANGE` will be treated as a _MAJOR_ change, but please do also add a `!` to the semver-type of a commit (e.g.: fix(icm)!:). This will help reading changelogs and release notes.
* A commit message starting with `feat(icm):` (or e.g.: `feat(pwa):`) will get a _MINOR_ change.
* The rest will be _PATCH_ .

Chart unreleated commits (like e.g. docs, chore, build, test) will not be taken into account but still should be conventional and informative as possible.
